The paper is based on two main contributions:
1. the collection of samples from three diverse datasets that test the performance of re-rankers, and 
2. careful evaluation of re-ranker performance based on novel metrics that compare re-ranker performance to a BM25 baseline. 

The code underlying these contributions is described below.

## Datasets for re-ranker evaluation

We collect samples from [NQ](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00276/43518/Natural-Questions-A-Benchmark-for-Question), LitQA2 (from [LAB-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/futurehouse/lab-bench)) and [DRUID](https://huggingface.co/datasets/copenlu/druid) for the evaluation of re-rankers. The samples are collected using the notebook [src/gather_data.ipynb](src/gather_data.ipynb).

We have also uploaded the processed evaluation datasets to [Hugging Face datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lo/rerankers-and-lexical-similarities), so one doesn't have to run the notebook mentioned above to get the evaluation datasets.

## Evaluation of re-rankers

We first collect our metric of interest for the dataset samples using [src/collect_metrics.ipynb](src/collect_metrics.ipynb). Our metrics of interest are:
- Various similarity scores (BERT scores, Jaccard similarities, BM25 scores)
- Various re-ranker scores (Cohere re-ranker, BGE re-ranker, and Jina re-rankers) 
 
We also collect re-ranker scores from GPT-4o m and GPT-4o. This approach is described in Appendix E in our paper.

Finally, the results are plotted in [src/evaluate.ipynb](src/evaluate.ipynb). For the analysis in the notebook, we assume that the data files with all relevant metrics have been prepared as described above.
